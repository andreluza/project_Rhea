## Modeling the distribution of Greater Rhea (*Rhea americana*) in Rio Grande do Sul
### André L. Luza, Arthur V. Rodrigues, Viviane Zulian & Gonçalo Ferraz

#### Who are we? What are we doing?

We are a team of researchers from Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM) and Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) interested in using citizen-science data to modeling the distribution of iconic and endangered species, such as the vinaceous-breasted amazon (*Amazona vinacea*) and the greater rhea (*Rhea americana*). This is a project focused on the greater rhea. 
The project aims to estimate the distribution of this species in the municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), the southermost state of Brazil. We will estimate distribution based on three sources of evidence: 1) detection data from citizen-science projects (e.g. e-bird, gbif), 2) expert knowledge, and 3) site-occupancy modeling based on the integration of data from different citizen-science projects.

#### What do we want from you?

We already get information from the first and third sources of evidence. Now, we need your help to gather data for the second source!! We kindly ask you to share your knowledge about the greater rhea distribution in RS. To help you with that, we built two iterative maps where you can drawn one or more polygons bounding the localities where you detected and / or know that rhea can be detected. These maps are: 1) map with the boundaries of the municipalities of RS, and 2) map of RS with the cover of natural grasslands (from Hofmann et al. 2015). We hope that these maps help you!

Cheers
